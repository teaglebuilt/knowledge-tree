# Domain Architecture Reference: [Domain Name]

> Use this template when creating new domain references. Every section is required to maintain consistency across domains.
>
> **File placement:** Place this file in the appropriate domain folder under `context/knowledge/architecture/`. If no folder exists for this domain group, create one. If a subject belongs alongside an existing domain (e.g., a new K8s-related tool), add it to that folder. Update any skill `SKILL.md` routing tables that reference domains after adding.
