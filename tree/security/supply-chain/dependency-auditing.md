# Dependency Auditing

## Critical Rules

- **Always** commit lock files to Git -- without them, CI resolves different versions than local
- **Never** automerge production dependency updates without passing tests and human review
- **Always** pin CI/CD actions to SHA digests, not tags -- tags can be force-pushed by compromised maintainers
- **Always** fix critical CVEs (CVSS 9.0+) within 24 hours; high (7.0+) within 7 days
- **Never** run `npm install` in CI -- use `npm ci` (installs from lock file exactly)

## The Principle

```
EVERY DEPENDENCY IS AN ATTACK SURFACE.
Audit proactively, not after the breach.
```

Your app's security is only as strong as its weakest transitive dependency.

## Tool Selection by Ecosystem

| Ecosystem | Audit Tool | Lock File | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| npm/yarn | `npm audit` / `yarn audit` | package-lock.json / yarn.lock | Built-in, JSON output for CI |
| pnpm | `pnpm audit` | pnpm-lock.yaml | Same flags as npm audit |
| Python (pip) | `pip-audit` | requirements.txt / poetry.lock | Queries OSV database |
| Python (pipenv) | `pipenv check` | Pipfile.lock | Uses Safety DB |
| Rust | `cargo audit` | Cargo.lock | RustSec advisory DB |
| Go | `govulncheck` | go.sum | Official Go tool, call-graph aware |
| Ruby | `bundler-audit` | Gemfile.lock | Ruby Advisory DB |
| Java/Kotlin | OWASP Dependency-Check / `gradle dependencyCheckAnalyze` | build.gradle.lock | NVD database |
| .NET | `dotnet list package --vulnerable` | packages.lock.json | Built-in since .NET 6 |

```bash
# Quick audit commands
npm audit --production          # Skip devDependencies
pip-audit -r requirements.txt   # Python
cargo audit                     # Rust
govulncheck ./...               # Go (analyzes actual call graph)
bundler-audit check --update    # Ruby (update advisory DB first)
```

## CVE Triage Workflow

### Step 1: Severity Assessment

| CVSS Score | Severity | SLA |
|------------|----------|-----|
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical | Fix within 24 hours |
| 7.0-8.9 | High | Fix within 7 days |
| 4.0-6.9 | Medium | Fix within 30 days |
| 0.1-3.9 | Low | Fix within 90 days or accept |

### Step 2: Exploitability Analysis

Not all CVEs are exploitable in your context. Ask:

1. **Is the vulnerable code path reachable?** (`govulncheck` does this automatically for Go)
2. **Is the vulnerable feature used?** (e.g., XML parsing CVE irrelevant if you only parse JSON)
3. **Is it exposed to untrusted input?** (internal-only service vs public API)
4. **Are there existing mitigations?** (WAF, input validation, sandboxing)

### Step 3: Decision Matrix

| Exploitable? | Upgrade Available? | Action |
|:---:|:---:|--------|
| Yes | Yes | Upgrade immediately |
| Yes | No | Apply workaround, monitor for patch, consider replacing dependency |
| No | Yes | Upgrade in next scheduled maintenance |
| No | No | Document risk acceptance with justification, set review date |

### Step 4: Response Options

| Response | When |
|----------|------|
| **Upgrade** | Patch version available, minimal breaking changes |
| **Patch** | Fork and patch if maintainer is unresponsive (last resort) |
| **Replace** | Dependency is unmaintained, better alternatives exist |
| **Mitigate** | Can't upgrade yet; add compensating controls (WAF rule, input validation) |
| **Accept** | Low risk, not exploitable in context; document and review quarterly |

## SBOM Generation

Software Bill of Materials -- inventory of all components in your software.

### Why SBOM Matters
- Required by US Executive Order 14028 for government contracts
- Enables rapid response when new CVEs drop (search your SBOM)
- License compliance auditing at scale

### Tools and Formats

| Tool | Format | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| `syft` (Anchore) | CycloneDX, SPDX | Container images, multi-ecosystem |
| `cdxgen` | CycloneDX | JS/Java/Python, CI-friendly |
| `trivy` | CycloneDX, SPDX | Container + filesystem scanning |
| `sbom-tool` (Microsoft) | SPDX | .NET ecosystems |

```bash
# Generate SBOM with syft
syft . -o cyclonedx-json > sbom.json
syft . -o spdx-json > sbom.spdx.json

# Scan container image
syft myimage:latest -o cyclonedx-json > sbom.json

# Scan SBOM for vulnerabilities
grype sbom:./sbom.json
```

## License Compliance

### License Categories

| Category | Licenses | Policy |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Permissive (safe) | MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, ISC | Allow |
| Weak copyleft (review) | LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0, MPL-2.0 | Allow with conditions (dynamic linking OK, modifications must share) |
| Strong copyleft (restrict) | GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0 | Block for proprietary software |
| No license | Unlicensed | Block (no license = all rights reserved) |

### Scanning Tools

```bash
# npm
npx license-checker --onlyAllow "MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;ISC"

# Python
pip install pip-licenses
pip-licenses --fail-on "GPL-2.0;GPL-3.0;AGPL-3.0"

# Multi-ecosystem
licensee detect .
```

## Dependabot & Renovate Configuration

See references/dependabot-renovate-config.md for Dependabot and Renovate configuration templates.

## CI Integration & Supply Chain Security

See references/ci-and-supply-chain.md for CI pipeline integration, severity gating, supply chain attack patterns, and version pinning strategies.

## Gotchas

- `npm audit` reports vulnerabilities in devDependencies that never ship to production; use `--production` or `--omit=dev` to filter
- `govulncheck` is call-graph aware (only reports reachable vulns); other tools report all vulns in dependency tree regardless of reachability
- CVSS scores don't account for YOUR context; a CVSS 9.8 in a function you never call is lower risk than a CVSS 6.0 in code you expose to the internet
- Transitive dependencies are where most vulnerabilities hide; direct deps are usually well-maintained
- Lock files must be committed to git; without them, `npm install` on CI may resolve different versions than local
- `pip-audit` requires a lock file or `--strict` for reproducible results; bare `requirements.txt` with ranges is insufficient
- License scanning misses dual-licensed packages and license changes between versions; verify manually for critical dependencies
- Dependabot/Renovate automerge should only be enabled for dev dependencies with good test coverage
