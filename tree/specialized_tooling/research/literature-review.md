# Literature Review for ML Research

## Search Strategy by Research Phase

### Decision Table: Search Approach

| Phase | Goal | Primary Source | Strategy |
|-------|------|---------------|----------|
| Scoping | Understand landscape | Survey papers, textbooks | Start broad, read abstracts only |
| Deep dive | Core related work | Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar | Citation graph: forward + backward |
| Gap finding | Identify what is missing | Recent venue proceedings | Filter by venue + year, read intros |
| Positioning | Place your contribution | Top-cited papers in subfield | Compare methods, build taxonomy |
| Camera-ready | Complete related work | arxiv, workshop papers | Fill gaps reviewers might flag |

### Decision Table: Source Selection

| Source | Best For | Limitations |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Google Scholar | Broad search, citation counts | Noisy results, includes predatory |
| Semantic Scholar | Citation graph, API access | Smaller index than GS |
| arxiv | Preprints, latest work | No peer review, variable quality |
| DBLP | Venue-specific search | Metadata only, no full text |
| Connected Papers | Visual citation graph | Limited to seed paper quality |
| Papers With Code | SOTA tables, code links | Benchmark-centric bias |
| ACL Anthology | NLP-specific | Single domain |

## Systematic Search Methodology

### Query Construction

```
# Start with core concept combinations
query_templates = [
    # Broad
    '"{method}" AND "{task}"',
    # Venue-scoped
    '"{method}" AND "{task}" site:arxiv.org',
    # Recent
    '"{method}" AND "{task}" after:2023',
    # Author-scoped
    'author:"{known_author}" "{topic}"',
]

# Example for a transformer efficiency paper:
queries = [
    '"efficient transformer" AND "long sequence"',
    '"linear attention" OR "sparse attention"',
    '"subquadratic" AND "self-attention"',
    '"flash attention" OR "memory efficient attention"',
]
```

### Semantic Scholar API Usage

```python
import requests
from typing import Optional

S2_API = "https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1"

def search_papers(
    query: str,
    year_range: Optional[str] = "2020-2025",
    limit: int = 20,
    fields: str = "title,year,citationCount,abstract,authors,venue",
) -> list[dict]:
    """Search Semantic Scholar for papers."""
    params = {
        "query": query,
        "limit": limit,
        "fields": fields,
    }
    if year_range:
        params["year"] = year_range
    resp = requests.get(f"{S2_API}/paper/search", params=params)
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return resp.json().get("data", [])

def get_citations(paper_id: str, direction: str = "citations") -> list[dict]:
    """Get forward (citations) or backward (references) links.

    direction: 'citations' (who cites this) or 'references' (who this cites)
    """
    fields = "title,year,citationCount,authors,venue"
    resp = requests.get(
        f"{S2_API}/paper/{paper_id}/{direction}",
        params={"fields": fields, "limit": 100},
    )
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return resp.json().get("data", [])

# Usage
papers = search_papers("flash attention efficient transformer")
for p in papers[:5]:
    print(f"[{p['year']}] {p['title']} (cited: {p['citationCount']})")
```

## Paper Summary Template

```markdown
### Paper: {Title}
- **Authors**: {First Author} et al., {Year}
- **Venue**: {Conference/Journal}
- **Citations**: {count} (as of {date})

#### Problem
{One sentence: what problem does this solve?}

#### Method
{2-3 sentences: key technical contribution}

#### Results
{Key numbers: which benchmarks, what improvement over what baseline}

#### Relevance to Our Work
{How it relates: extends/contradicts/enables/competes with our approach}

#### Limitations
{What they don't address that we do, or known weaknesses}
```

## Comparison Table Template

```markdown
| Method | Year | Task | Key Idea | Complexity | Acc. | Code |
|--------|------|------|----------|------------|------|------|
| Method A | 2023 | X | Does Y via Z | O(n log n) | 92.1 | Yes |
| Method B | 2024 | X | Does Y via W | O(n) | 93.4 | No |
| Ours | 2025 | X | Does Y via V | O(n) | 94.2 | Yes |
```

## Taxonomy Construction

### Building a Taxonomy

```
Step 1: Collect 30-50 papers in the space
Step 2: Tag each paper along orthogonal axes:
  - Approach type (e.g., attention-based, convolution-based, hybrid)
  - Training paradigm (supervised, self-supervised, few-shot)
  - Scale (small model, foundation model)
  - Application domain (vision, language, multimodal)
Step 3: Group papers that share tags -> these form taxonomy branches
Step 4: Identify sparse cells -> these are research gaps
```

## Staying Current

### Monitoring Strategy

| Channel | Frequency | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| arxiv-sanity / Hugging Face Daily Papers | Daily | Skim titles, star relevant |
| Key author Twitter/X feeds | Weekly | Note new preprints |
| Top venue proceedings (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) | Per cycle | Read all accepted in subfield |
| Google Scholar alerts | As notified | Check forward citations of key papers |
| ML subreddits, Discord servers | Weekly | Track community reception |

### arxiv Monitoring Script

```python
import arxiv

def search_recent(
    query: str,
    max_results: int = 20,
    sort_by: arxiv.SortCriterion = arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate,
) -> list[dict]:
    """Fetch recent arxiv papers matching query."""
    search = arxiv.Search(
        query=query,
        max_results=max_results,
        sort_by=sort_by,
    )
    results = []
    for paper in search.results():
        results.append({
            "title": paper.title,
            "authors": [a.name for a in paper.authors[:3]],
            "abstract": paper.summary[:200],
            "url": paper.entry_id,
            "published": paper.published.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        })
    return results

papers = search_recent("cat:cs.LG AND ti:efficient AND ti:attention")
```

## Gotchas and Anti-Patterns

### Citation Bias
- Over-citing top labs / top venues while ignoring work from smaller groups.
- Citing only papers that support your narrative. Reviewers will flag missing contradicting work.
- **Fix**: Explicitly search for papers that contradict or weaken your claims. Include them and explain differences.

### Missing Non-Arxiv Work
- Many fields publish primarily in journals (medical imaging, robotics). Arxiv-only search misses these.
- Workshop papers often contain early versions of important ideas.
- **Fix**: Search DBLP and Google Scholar in addition to arxiv. Check domain-specific repositories (e.g., PubMed for medical ML).

### Conflating Citation Count with Impact
- Recent papers have low citation counts regardless of quality.
- Some high-citation papers are cited mainly for datasets, not methods.
- **Fix**: Weight recent papers by venue and author track record, not citations alone. Read the paper before citing.

### Recency Bias
- Ignoring foundational older work that established the concepts you build on.
- Citing the latest version of an idea without crediting the original.
- **Fix**: Trace ideas back to their origin. Cite both the original and the most relevant recent extension.

### Superficial Reading
- Citing based on abstract only leads to mischaracterization.
- **Fix**: For any paper in your related work section, read at minimum: abstract, intro, method section, and main results table. For direct competitors, read the full paper.

### Incomplete Search Termination
- Stopping search when you have "enough" references without systematic coverage.
- **Fix**: Define search scope upfront (queries, venues, year range). Track coverage in a spreadsheet. Stop when new queries return only already-seen papers.

## Comprehensive Literature Review

For reviews covering 30+ papers across multiple sources, analyze sequentially:

1. **Database Search** — Systematic search across databases (Semantic Scholar, arXiv, Google Scholar, ACL Anthology)
2. **Citation Analysis** — Forward/backward citation tracing from seed papers
3. **Methodology Review** — Categorize methods, identify trends, assess rigor
4. **Gap Analysis** — Synthesize findings, identify contradictions and research gaps
