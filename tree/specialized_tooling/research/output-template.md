## Process Guidelines

- Read the full paper across all three passes before writing the summary
- Be precise — use exact numbers from the paper
- Distinguish between what the paper claims and what the evidence supports
- For critical analysis, be honest and constructive — identify real issues, not nitpicks
- The summary should be self-contained: someone reading it should understand the paper without reading the original
- **Score calibration:** 6-7 = good paper with solid contribution; 8+ = genuinely strong/exceptional; don't grade-inflate
- **Omit N/A sections** rather than filling them with "Not applicable" placeholders
- **Novelty assessment:** compare against the closest specific prior work, not the field in general
- **TL;DR:** draft after Pass 1, refine after Pass 3
- **Resource links:** require genuine search effort — use "Not available" for expected resources (official code) and "None found" for optional ones (blog posts, videos)
