### README Rules
- Install block within first screenful
- Working code example that can be copy-pasted directly
- No "Table of Contents" unless doc exceeds 5 screens
- Link out to detailed docs rather than inlining everything
- Keep badges to 3-5 max; CI, version, license are standard

### Newcomer-Focused Documentation
- Write READMEs assuming the reader has **minimal context** -- aim to get them productive quickly
- Include: high-level purpose, major concepts/abstractions, how it fits into the broader ecosystem
- Give directions (or better yet, a real working example) on how to get a concrete integration running
- Keep it concise -- long docs get skimmed, short docs get read
